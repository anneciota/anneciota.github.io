<p>~ “Every coaching session I had with Anne was great!  Anne gave me the tools I needed to clear out limiting beliefs and the opportunity to gain insight, clarity and direction in my life.  I felt very connected, and her fun-loving yet firm style of delivery enabled me to keep on track and feel more empowered after each session.  She made me laugh and take notice that playing small doesn’t serve anyone or anything!  I truly recommend her to anyone ready (and maybe even not so ready) to move forward and embrace positive changes in his/her life.” – Pam from Florida</p>
<p>~ “Anne is an incredibly giving and nurturing person…  She is intuitive and insightful. I have grown so much since beginning my work with her. She has taught me so much about myself but, more importantly, she has given me tools to be able to heal emotionally from the hurts in my life. I now feel like I have the ongoing ability to deal with the challenges in my life.” – P.F., Massachusetts</p>
<p>~ “Working with Anne was very helpful. In very quick fashion she helped me resolve an important and key issue. This is something I have tried to work on for a long time. I have no emotional charge around this now and feel this frees me up for moving on in many areas of my life.” – Connie in Connecticut</p>
<p>~ “I am so thankful for the compassion, care, generosity, support, kindness and understanding you have shown me. You helped me through much of the darkness, despair and hopelessness that once consumed my life, and always gave me the needed encouragement and hope that healing was and is possible!! I have learned so much from you, in terms of using tools to heal and empower myself.” – Nina, age 25</p>
<p>~ “I really felt better. I was thinking with a lot more clarity. It enabled me to know myself better and gave me a sense of well-being.” – J.K., age 50</p>
<p>~ “It is great to have met you and I deeply appreciate the work we did together. I was looking for something to “move me off the spot” in terms of addressing and releasing some emotional baggage. I truly wanted to better understand my thinking, motives and the “why” of my behaviors. To see if there were patterns for me that I thought were protecting me, but in fact were actually inhibiting growth… Your approach, which includes other alternative modalities like EFT, TAT and the Emotion Code was exactly what I needed. It was interesting and I saw results immediately. It also allowed me to take away tools to use on my own. I felt wonderful, with a gift of insight and a practice for my continued exploration of me. Thank you for being part of my journey of self discovery.” – Nancy, New Hampshire</p>
<p>~ “The work with Anne using the Emotion Code was profound and deeply healing. I highly recommend her and this technique.” – Sue, age 45</p>
<p>~ “Using The Emotion Code has been, literally, transformational for me. In my first session of the Emotion Code, anxiety and stress melted away effortlessly. I was astounded that healing could occur so gently and so quickly… Additional Emotion Code sessions have lifted depression, swept away grief, and erased fear. I am experiencing happiness, improved health and, for the first time in a very long time, I look forward to each day with joyful anticipation.” – Anne, age 59</p>
<p>~ “Tapas Acupressure Therapy (TAT) is like a breath of fresh air. I appreciate the gentle ease of the technique. I am in awe of the instantaneous effectiveness of TAT.  With each session I emerge more joyful and I feel a strong, fresh renewal of self. My life has changed dramatically in a positive direction… I feel a freedom and excitement for life that I haven’t felt since I was a child.” – Diane, New Hampshire</p>
