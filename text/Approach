<p>As your coach or energy psychology practitioner, or a combination of both, my role is as your guide and facilitator.</p>

<h3>Coaching for Transformation</h3>

<p>Coaching is a powerful way to change something in your life. Perhaps you are feeling stuck or trapped and unable to move forward and achieve your goals. A good question to ask yourself: What else is possible?</p>
<p>What keeps us stuck? Most often it is our subconscious minds which “run the show.” To move forward we need to identify and clear these self-sabotaging limiting beliefs. Some of the most common ones are: “I don’t deserve,” “I’m not enough,” “It’s not safe,” “I’m afraid to fail,” “I’m afraid to succeed,” and “I’m not worthy.”</p>
<p>Coaching enables you to transform your limiting beliefs, increase your confidence and, utilizing the Law of Attraction, become unstuck. We will work together to set goals and create what you desire. You can transform your life. I know this for certain: <i>You are worth it!</i></p>

<h3>Energy Psychology</h3>
<p>Energy Psychology is a term which encompasses a variety of mind-body approaches. These powerful techniques decrease stress, clear limiting beliefs, release trauma and facilitate rapid positive change. The ones I use most often are listed below.</p>

<p><b>EFT or Tapping</b>, writes founder Gary Craig, “combines the physical benefits of acupuncture with the cognitive benefits of conventional therapy for a much faster, more complete treatment of emotional issues, and the physical and performance issues that often result.” It has been called psychological acupuncture without needles. Research has shown that it shifts brain patterns that lead to unwanted thoughts, actions and emotions. It is used worldwide to relieve emotional and physical issues, and most of my clients would heartily agree that it is a terrific self-help tool.</p>

<p><b>The Emotion Code</b>, according to Dr. Bradley Nelson, “has been created to give you new insight, to show you how trapped emotions can cause all kinds of problems, and give you the means to release them. You can take your life back, enjoy better health, and finally be free from the insidious and subtle forces that trapped emotions are exerting upon you.” I have found that clearing a person’s “Heart Wall” can be extremely powerful, as it “blocks you in your ability to give and receive love freely, and it will create depression, numbness and a sense of isolation, and anxiety and self-sabotage. Because it blocks your creative abilities, it will also block you from success.”</p>

<p><b>TAT</b>, developed by acupuncturist Tapas Fleming, “is a process which focuses the user on a series of statements while holding acupressure points that connect all physical, mental, emotional and spiritual parts of them.” She also writes, “TAT helps to heal the emotional causes of trauma, physical illnesses, phobias, negative beliefs and negative patterns.” My clients almost always find it extremely relaxing to do TAT. Besides being a great de-stressor, it is a great tool to use to create the life you want to live.</p>

<p><b>SRT/Spiritual Response Technique</b> - Operating at a soul level, SRT is a powerful technique which releases negative energies and beliefs from current and past lives, and replaces them with positive ones.
